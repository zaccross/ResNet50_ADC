# ResNet50_ADC
## Project Repo for my Summer 2022 Term Paper. Automatic Defect Classifier for Metal Surface defects from NEU-DET


This Repository contains the 3 python files used to make and train my model. ResNet.py contains the actual ResNet class as well as builds the
ResNet50,101,and 152. Model_Training contains the training and testing structure, and Data_Augment contains the transforms to take the 1800 images ->
28800.
